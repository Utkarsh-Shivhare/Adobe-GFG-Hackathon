Approach Used:-
  * Used a pytorch model to detect shape it is, circle rectangle elipse star and so on.
  * once I get predictions from the model specific to the polyline, goes to multiple condition.
  * Build individual algos to regularize the specific shape.
  * At last updating the polylines with the upgraded points and regularised polylines.
